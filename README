    - Vaadin-powered UI
    - Spring-powered backend
    - Maven build with JRebel plugin
    - Spring security with HTTP digest auth + simple permissions

    - AspectJ ITDs and compile-time weaving + @Configurable
    
    TODO: Table item paging (via a container?), i18n (plugin to component rendering so that one could provide message
    keys to setCaption() etc. ?), declarative UI component hiding per user's authorities (plugin to rendering system?).

Note: This is WIP, subject to change at any time. I'm just using this to learn Vaadin.
